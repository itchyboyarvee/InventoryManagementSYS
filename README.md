## Introduction

The purpose of this final project for Elective 1 and MNSTDEV is to showcase the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the semester. The development process began with establishing the core elements that ensure security, usability, and scalability key traits of a reliable and user-friendly system. The primary focus was on implementing foundational features necessary for user interaction and access control. By integrating essential components such as user authentication and a centralized dashboard, the system is well-prepared for future enhancements while maintaining a secure and organized structure from the outset.

## Features Implemented

In this project, I implemented the core foundational features of the system, focusing on user authentication and basic navigation. Specifically, I developed a Login and Signup system to manage user access securely. Additionally, I created a Dashboard interface that users are directed to after logging in, providing a central hub for future functionalities. These components establish the initial framework of the system and lay the groundwork for further development.
